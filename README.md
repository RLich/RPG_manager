# RPG_manager
Small project to help my friend group of tabletop RPG lovers to better organize our RPG meetings.

Features:
- Pulling data from the Google Spreadsheet that we use to mark our availability for a given day;
- Generating a list of possible game sessions for further acceptance;
- Generating a list of people who did not declare their availability for a given day;
- Storing results on a separate .json files in a human-readable manner.
- Automatic sending of notifications via Messenger (currently using GUI, maybe I'll find some API):
   * About missing declarations to be filled
   * About incoming session

Plans:
- Collecting responses and creating a confirmed sessions list;
- Creating a Google Calendar (or similar) events for confirmed sessions;
- maybe more...
