# RPG_manager
Small project to help my friend group of tabletop RPG lovers to better organize our RPG meetings.

Features:
- Pulling data from the Google Spreadsheet that we use to mark our availability for a given day;
- Generating a list of possible game sessions for further acceptance;
- Generating a list of people who did not declare their availability for a given day;
- Storing results on a seperate .json files in a human-readable manner.

Plans:
- Setting up some sort of CRON job to run this program via a schedule;
- Automatic sending of notifications via email or Messenger (please let there be an api for that, i don't want to use GUI :/);
- Collecting responses and creating a confirmed sessions list;
- Creating a Google Calendar (or similar) events for confirmed sessions;
- maybe more...
